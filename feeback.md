### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)? __2 Exceeds expectations__

  * A **hosted copy of your game or app, built by you**, hosted on Github Pages

    :+1:

  * Your HTML/CSS should pass the [HTML5 Validator](https://html5.validator.nu) and [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

    :+1::+1: Excellent!


  * A **git repository hosted on Github** with frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project

    :+1: 59 commits! Love it

  * A **link to your hosted project** in the URL section of your Github repo

    :+1:

  * **A ``readme.md`` file**, including
    * Explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

      :+1: Could also include normalize.css, css transitions and transformations, font-awesome, and the jquery scrollTo library to your technologies used. This will be helpful down the road when you are talking to employers about experience with particular technologies and you can quickly find what you've worked with and a little note on how that experience was

    * At least 5 [user stories](https://github.com/ga-dc/curriculum/tree/master/02-intermediate-front-end/process-stories-wireframes).

      :+1::+1::+1: 21 user stories on a trello board! Killing it!

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex? __2 Exceeds expectations__

  Your app must:

  * **Render in the browser** :+1:
  * **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files** :+1:
  * Stick with **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)** and **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles :+1: had one note about listening for keypresses
  * Use **Javascript or jQuery** for **DOM manipulation** :+1:
  * **Deploy online**, using [Github **Project** pages](https://pages.github.com). :+1:
  * Use **semantic markup** for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices) :+1:

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class? __2 Exceeds expectations__

  _Really great job. I left a few comments in your code which open with 'jsm:'. The things you can improve structurally are going to be the main topic of the next couple weeks (as well as how to persist data). There were a couple comments you left at the bottom which I asked for clarification on and I'm definitely happy to follow up on that._


* __Problem Solving__: Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations? __2 Exceeds expectations__

  _Love the idea of using projects to try out a couple things you'd like to know more about. It's both a great way to learn as well as take your project over the top. Really like the airplane icon and I'm super impress with the CYO functionality!_


* __Total__: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between: __2 Exceeds expectations__

Score | Expectations
----- | ------------
**0** | _Does not meet expectations._
**1** | _Meets expectactions, good job!_
**2** | _Exceeds expectations_



This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
