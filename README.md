### Alpha - Zulu

Alpha - Zulu is a flashcard application to help aspiring private pilots memorize important information like the phonetic alphabet and emergency procedure checklists. It allows the user to:
- flip to the opposite side of the card
- cycle forwards and backwards through the stack
- get a random card from the stack
- mark a flashcard complete and remove it from the stack.
- refresh the flashcard stack

The user can also create a customized stack of up to 50 flashcards.

2. As a user, I should be able to view the other side of the card to read the "answer".
3. As a user, I should be able to cycle through the flashcards to move on to the next card.
4. As a user, I should be able to check whether my answer was correct.
